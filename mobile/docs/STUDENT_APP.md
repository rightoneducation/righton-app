# Student App

Exported from `src/Student/index.js` is the Switch Navigation that serves as the entry file for the Student App.

## Switch Navigation

### EnterGameCode

The initial screen which displays after selecting `I am a student` from the `JoinGame` screen. The naming convention for this screen needs to be updated since its main purpose is to allow a more "efficient" game room joining experience.

### StudentProfile

This screen is accessed from pressing the circular profile icon on the top left corner of the `Dashboard`. This screen allows the student to access the `OnboardAccount` screens under the premise that the user is a student.
