      "question": "A child is raising a flag up a 20-foot flag pole. She starts pulling at a rate of 2 feet per second for 5 seconds, but she starts to get tired and decreases her rate to 1/2 foot per second for the remainder of the time. In total, how many seconds does it take her to raise the flag from the bottom to the top?",
      "correctAnswer": "25",
      "correctExplanation": "1. Distance = (rate)(time). You might see this if you use the units in your equation. For the first 5 seconds, the child raises the flag up the pole at a rate of 2 ft/s. If we multiply those together, we can see that the seconds cancel: (2 ft/s)(5 s) = 10 feet 2. The flag is 10 feet up the 20-foot pole before the child gets tired, which means that she still has to raise the flag another 10 feet.  3. At a rate of 1/2 ft/s for the remainder of the task, we are solving the following equation for t to find the remaining time it takes her to raise the flag up the rest of the pole: (1/2 ft/s)(t seconds) = 10 feet. This yields t = 20 seconds as the remaining time.4. Adding the 5 seconds (from raising the flag at 2 ft/s for the first 10 feet) and 20 seconds (from raising the flag at 1/2 ft/s for the second 10 feet), we get a total time of 25 seconds. ",
      "incorrectAnswers": [
        {
          "answer": "10",
          "explanation": "At an initial rate of 2 ft/s for 5 seconds, the child raises the flag (2 ft/s)(5 s) = 10 feet. To calculate the time for the child to raise the flag the second 10 feet, you need to solve the equation 10 = (1/2)(t). You will find that t = 20 seconds. This is the amount of time it takes the child to raise the flag at 1/2 ft/s for the second 10 feet. Instead of the above calculation, students may have incorrectly multiplied 1/2 ft/s by 10 ft to get 5 seconds (and 5 + 5 = 10). Note that if you accidentally multiplied 1/2 ft/s x 10 ft, you would actually get 5 ft^2/s (not 5 s)."

        {
          "answer": "20",
          "explanation": "Students may have correctly found that it took 20 seconds to raise the flag the second 10 feet, but not remembered to add it to the 5 seconds that were used to raise the flag the first 10 feet: 5 seconds (for the first 10 feet) + 20 seconds (for the second 10 feet) = 25 seconds total"

        {
          "answer": "13.75",
          "explanation": "Students may have confused the relationship between distance, rate and time. Instead of distance = (rate)(time), they may have thought (distance)(rate) = time. To find the height, they then might have thought they needed to solve (d feet)(2 feet/second) = 5 seconds, yielding d = 2.5 feet. [Note that the units in this equation do not make sense: on the left you have (ft)(ft/s), which would result in (ft^2)/s, while on the right you have just seconds.] To get the remaining time it takes to raise the flag the remaining 17.5 feet, they might try to use the same incorrect equation (17.5 feet)(1/2 feet/second) = t seconds, yielding 8.75 seconds. Students might then add 5 + 8.75 seconds to get 13.75 seconds."

This would have led them to believe that 6^2 was 12 (instead of 36) and 2x would evaluate to 26 (instead of (2)(6)=12).

      "correctAnswer": "-9",
      "correctExplanation": "1. First, you must distribute the 3 on the left side of the equation to both terms of (x + 15): 3(x + 15) - 6x = -6(x - 3) 3x + 45 - 6x = -6(x - 3) 2. Now, we need to distribute the -6 on the right side of the equation to both terms of (x - 3): 3x + 45 - 6x = -6x + 18 Remember that (-6)(-3) = 18 because the product of two negative numbers is positive.  3. Now we can add 6x to both sides of the equation to eliminate the x term on the right: 3x + 45 - 6x + 6x = -6x + 6x + 183x + 45 = 184. Finally, we can subtract 45 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the 45 on the left:3x + 45 - 45 = 18 - 453x = -27 5. We can now divide both sides by 3 to solve for x 3x/3 = -27/3 x = -9 It's important to check your answers, so let's see if x = -9 works! 3(-9 + 15) - 6(-9) = -6(-9-3) 3(6) + 54 = -6(-12) 18 + 54 = 72  TRUE!!!",

      "correctExplanation": "1. Since x represents the number of movie tickets Sam bought and she spent $10 on each movie ticket, then the total money she spent on movie tickets is represented by 10x. 2. Since y represents the number of bags of popcorn Sam bought and she spent $2 on each bag of popcorn, then total amount of money she spent on popcorn is represented by 2y. 3. The total amount Sam spent, $78, is the sum of what she spent on movie tickets, 10x, andwhat she spent on popcorn, 2y, which yields the equation 10x + 2y = 78. 4. She bought 3 more movie tickets, x, than she bought bags of popcorn, y. In other words, x is 3 more than y. We can interpret 'is' as '='. So, x = 3 + y. 5. To ensure that you've interpreted this last sentence correctly, it helps to check your equation by using some hypothetical, or made-up, numbers.
