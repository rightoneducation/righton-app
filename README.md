# RightOn Education

### Our Mission & Vision
<strong>Mission:</strong> Maybe you too know kids (or even adults) who'll say things like, "I'm not a math person." or "I just can't do science." Our mission is to unlock every student’s potential in STEM: building self-confidence, developing conceptual understanding, and helping them overcome hurdles in both school & life: whether they'd like to build apps, go to Mars, or become the next Beyonce!

While many apps focus on getting answers as quickly as possible, we're turning things around: RightOn not only makes it OK to make mistakes: players get rewarded for the most popular wrong answers. Through learning from mistakes and misconceptions, everyone takes their learning to the next level.

<strong>Vision:</strong> In the future, we envision <a href="https://www.rightoneducation.com"><strong><i>RightOn!</i></strong></a> to become a multimedia learning platform and game show (spanning mobile apps and livestream video), one that eventually helps connect students of all ages and backgrounds to learn new subjects -- from math today to others in the future. 

### Our Values
We’re a team that sometimes falls down, always gets back up, and never stops having fun.<br>
<strong>Trust and open communication:</strong> first seeking to understand, then to be understood<br>
<strong>Integrity:</strong> doing the right thing<br>
<strong>Compassion:</strong> lending a hand to others, giving back, expressing gratitude<br>
<strong>Humility:</strong> working together on something bigger than ourselves<br>
<strong>Beginner’s mindset:</strong> going into things with an open mind, always learning and making new mistakes<br>
<strong>Fun:</strong> having fun along the way!<br>

### Project Description
We're currently developing two apps:
1. A React Native mobile app for middle/high school teachers to use in classroom environments. Think Balderdash/Fibbage + STEM + learning from and having fun with mistakes and misconceptions. 
2. A React web app that enables teachers to create games/questions that appear in the mobile app and view classroom results.

We're running on AWS, including AppSync/GraphQL, DynamoDB, and Lambda. A future phase might include a livestream game show with elements similar to the following <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/04/27/mrbeast-youtube-creator-games-nadeshot-ninja/"><strong>online rock-papers-scissors tournament</strong></a>. 

### Getting Started

Click into the <a href="https://github.com/rightoneducation/righton-app/tree/dev/web">**web**</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rightoneducation/righton-app/tree/dev/mobile">**mobile**</a> directory to learn how to get started. 

### Files Needed

The `react-native` npm package.
<br>
A `local.properties` file if testing on Android.
<br>
The Xcode editor if testing on iOS.
<br>

#### Notes:
Some NPM packages may be out of date and need to be updated for the Android build.
<br>
If you encounter the following error:
<br>
> A problem occurred evaluating project ':amazon-cognito-identity-js'.
> Could not find method implementation() for arguments [com.facebook.react:react-native:+]
<br>
Locate the `build.gradle` file in `node_modules/amazon-cognito-identity.js/android`, find the line mentioned in the `dependencies` object, and change `implementation` to `compile`.
<br>
<br>
If you receive a `hasteImpl returning the same name for different files` error in your packager: This is due to identical path names created by AWS Amplify. To fix this issue, simply drag the `#current-cloud-backend` folder from `${root}/amplify` out, restart the packager and run again.
